# codeigniter4-auth
Based on [Ben Edmund's CodeIgniter Ion Auth](https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)

Simple and lightweight authentication for your CodeIgniter apps.

Note, this version is meant to be used with CodeIgniter 4 and is not backwards compatible with previous versions.  The database is backwards compatible though for those migrating from previous versions.

### Important
Please use the original [Ben Edmund's CodeIgniter Ion Auth](https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)


## Server requirements
Ion Auth 4 needs **CodeIgniter 4**.
